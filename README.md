Explaining the concept of unit test in Swift language using Xcode

## What is Unit Testing?
* In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. 
* Using unit testing, we verify our core functionality, common workflow, boundary conditions, etc.
* Unit tests are usually written by developers and can be written before, during and after development.
